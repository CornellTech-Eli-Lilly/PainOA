 	 <p> The purpose of this study is to generate informed decision making capabilities on both the sides of the physician and osteoarthritis patient in order to better understand pain symptoms and proper treatment. This application will take passive and manually entered data from the osteoarthritis patient and provide the physician with a report on activity levels within a certain time series. </p>

    <p>The product is a collaboration between Cornell Tech and Eli Lilly and Co. with technology support from Apple, Sage Bionetworks, and LifeMap Solutions. We expect that hundreds or thousands of people may join this study. </p>

    People with osteoarthritis do best when actively managing their daily life. This app uses your mobile phone to help you do this. If you take daily medication, the app will help you remember to take it on schedule. There are links to learn more about osteoarthritis, how to use your medicine, and how to recognize when you should see your doctor. The information you put into the app will help you track your activity levels and track your performance over time. Although we will look at the data at different points during the study, we will not be looking at your osteoarthritis information each day. The app does not replace your usual medical care, so if your condition worsens during the study, please reach out to your health care team.</p>

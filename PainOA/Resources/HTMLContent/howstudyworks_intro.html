  <h1>How the Study Works</h1>
        	<p>PainOA has several user-friendly features:</p>
              
              <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
        	  <li><boldie>Log your health behaviors:</boldie> Survey questions will periodically ask you about taking your medicines, your region-specific pain intensity, and your overall activity levels.</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Track your physical activity:</boldie> your iPhoneâ€™s accelerometer will do this automatically for you! Just remember to carry your iPhone with you (e.g., in your pants pocket, or a holster clipped to your waist).</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Insights into your activity levels:</boldie> PainOA uses visualizations and text summaries to display how your physical activity affects your health.</li>
           		</ul>
        	<p>PainOA encrypts your data, separates it from your identity, and adds your data to a secure research database. This will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and pain values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help physicians better understand the complex relationships between activity levels and symptoms exhibited in osteoarthritis. It will also help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research. </p>
        	<p>We will explain the risks and benefits of the study as part of an informed consent process.</p>

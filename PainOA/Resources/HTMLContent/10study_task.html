        <p>PainOA will also ask about some information that requires you to input data into iPhone, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recording your pain level</li>
            <li>Where your pain is located</li>
            <li>How frequently you take pain medication</li>
            <li>And your activity level </li>
        </ul>
        <p>PainOA provides personalized feedback in the form of g raphs and text to display your progress, and provide insights into your health behaviors. The app summarizes data about how activity, sleep, and medication patterns are associated with your osteoarthritis pain values.  These insights may help you understand your health behaviors better, help you manage your osteoarthritis symptoms, and help your doctors create a more personalized pain treatment plan. Viewing the graphs and text is optional but may be useful or interesting to you.</p>
        <p>For the passive sensing of your physical activity to be accurate, it&rsquo;s important to carry your iPhone on your person (e.g., in your pocket, or clipped to your waist).</p>
        <p>In your Profile within PainOA, you can set   reminders for yourself to  complete app activities. In general,  more data  entered  in the app results in  more accurate and informative  insights.</p>
